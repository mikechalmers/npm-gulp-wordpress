uses a modified [barebones](https://github.com/benchmarkstudios/barebones) template

type "gulp" to process

look at gulpfile.js to see what's going on

it might be helpful to have an action / pipeline to FTP the theme folder to the server

## Wordpress theme

- change the theme folder in gulpfile.js
- change the theme settings in src/scss/style.scss

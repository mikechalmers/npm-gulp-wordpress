# Wordpress with Gulp and NPM

23/9/2022

uses a modified [barebones](https://github.com/benchmarkstudios/barebones) template

automatically adds bootstrap CSS and JavaScript to style.css and main.js respectively

type "gulp" to process

look at gulpfile.js to see what's going on

it might be helpful to have an action / pipeline to FTP the theme folder to the server

## Wordpress theme

- change the theme folder in gulpfile.js
- change the theme settings in src/scss/style.scss
